# GetPicFromTistory

One of my close friend is a crazy Kpop fan. She worships a girl 
group and runs a fan site providing daily news and activities 
of those idols. One day she asked me if I could help her collect 
some photos from a tistory.com website. It's kind of a tedious 
job if doing manually, so I wrote this code.

In South Korea, usually when an idol group member is going to 
have public activity, the group's official website will announce 
the schedule in advance. So that the fans in Korea could take 
the chance to meet their goddess outside a TV station or in the 
airport. After that, they will upload the photos they took of 
that idol to their own blog website. And obviously, many of them 
choose to locate the blog on tistory.com.

Featuring:

1. Collect the original-size photos from all recorded blogs.
2. Provide most common translations from Korean to Chinese, letting users to choose.
3. Record each update. breakpoint resume.
